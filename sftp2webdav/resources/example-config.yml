  # --- SSL Verification ---
  # How to verify the WebDAV server's SSL certificate.
  #
  # - true: (Default) Verify against your system's trusted CAs. Use this for
  #   servers with a valid, publicly trusted certificate (e.g., from Let's Encrypt).
  #
  # - false: Do NOT verify the certificate. This is insecure and should only
  #   be used for testing with local servers that have a self-signed cert.
  #
  # - "/path/to/your/server.crt": To trust a specific self-signed certificate,
  #   provide the full path to the server's public certificate file (.crt or .pem).
  verify_ssl: true

  # --- Client Certificate (Advanced) ---
  # The 'cert' option is for client-side SSL authentication, where the server
  # verifies the client's identity. This is not common.
  # To use it, provide the path to a file containing both the client's
  # certificate and private key.
  # cert: /path/to/client-cert-and-key.pem

target_dir: path/to/target/dir/ # The destination folder on the WebDAV server
